# Python Learning Path
This repo is dedicated personally as a supplementary learning for development, particulary Data Structures and Algorithm.

## Learning Roadmap

    * Understand how to write comments in your code.
3. Variables and Data Types
    * Learn about different data types: integers, floats, strings, booleans.
    * Understand variable naming rules and conventions
    * Learn how to assign values to variables.
4. Operators
    * Learn about arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.
    * Understand operator precedence.
5. Control Structures
    * Learn about if statements for conditional execution.
    * Explore loops: for loops and while loops.
    * Understand how to use break and continue statements.
6. Collections 
    * Learn about lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
    * Understand how to access, modify, and iterate over these data structures.
7. Functions
    * Learn how to define and call functions.
    * Understand the concept of parameters and return values.
    * Explore the concept of scope and variable visibility.
8. String Manipulation:
    * Learn how to work with strings: concatenation, slicing, formatting.
    * Understand escape characters and raw strings.
9. Input and Output
    * Learn how to take user input and display output.
    * Explore the input() and print() functions.
10. Exception handling 
    * Understand how to use try-except blocks for error handling.
    * Learn about different types of exceptions and how to handle them.
11. Lists and List Comprehensions:
    * Dive deeper into lists and learn about list methods.
    * Explore list comprehensions for concise list creation.
12. Dictionaries and Sets
    * Learn more about dictionaries and their methods.
    * Understand sets and their use cases.
13. File Handling 
    * Learn how to read from and write to files.
    * Explore modes (read, write, append) and context managers (with statements).
14. Modules and Libraries
    * Understand how to import and use built-in and third-party modules.
    * Explore common libraries like math and random.
15. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics
    * Learn about classes and objects.
    * Understand the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
16. Basic Debugging
    * Learn how to identify and fix common errors (syntax errors, logical errors).
    * Explore tools like print statements and debugging in IDEs.
17. Basic Project Development
    * Apply the concepts you've learned to create small projects.
    * Practice problem-solving and breaking down tasks into manageable steps.
